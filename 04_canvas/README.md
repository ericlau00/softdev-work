# K #04: I See a Red Door...

Due **R 2020-02-06**, 08:00, EST.

As a duo, create a webpage using HTML5 and JavaScript:

- `clickdraw.html`:
  - Must contain a canvas -- though it may skew minimalist or baroque.
  - Must have a clear button that wipes the canvas clean.
  - Must have a toggle button that switches between draw-a-rectangle mode and draw-a-dot mode.
- `clickdraw.js`:
  - Facilitates drawing of a box or dot on the canvas...
    - when a user clicks within the border of the canvas (but not outside).
    - at mouse location
  - Facilitates clearing of the canvas when user clicks clear button.
  - Employs a state variable for box|dot.

File this under **04_canvas** in your workshop.
