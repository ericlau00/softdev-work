K #08: Lemme Flask You Sumpâ€™n

Due R 2019-09-19, 08:00, EST.


Your (solo) job:

Write a Flask app with 3 routes.

File this under 08_app0 in your workshop.


Simplicity is divine.
Note anything notable. (in your notebook and in-line comments in your code)
Use QAF liberally.from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hi():
	return "moustache"

@app.route("/my_foist_template")
def temp():
	coll = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]
	return """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
</head>
	<body>
	{% for i in coll %}
		{{i}}
		<br/>
	{% endfor %}
	</body>
</html>
		"""
if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.debug = True
	app.run()
