Due **R 2020-04-02** 08:00 EST

Estimated time required: <=30min

With your current buddy…

- Copy the JS event propagation experimentation files from N&C repo to your new workshop folder. (4 folders, numbered 1-4)
- Create a plaintext file in the root of your new workshop folder called `capbub-notes_<teamname>.txt`
- Review the HTML and JS for v1, predict how its page will behave when clicked upon.
- Record predictions, observations, questions, comments, concerns, and anything else notable in your notes file.
- Lather, rinse, repeat for v2-4.
- Refactor last work if you like, and include in the root level of your new workshop folder.

Save to workshop under 15_svg. Folder structure below:
