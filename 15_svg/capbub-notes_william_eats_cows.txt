v1
Before:
- We think clicking on the names will alert the user with the name clicked on (that's it).

After:
- Our predictions was correct

v2
Before:
- Q: When user clicks on a cell, in what order will the pop-ups appear?
    - We think that the alert will print out in this order:
        1. The name of the star wars character (table data innerHTML)
        2. The html of the table row that has the star wars character
        3. The html of the table will be printed

After:
- We were correct
- Chrome version 80 inserts <tbody> into our html, so this was shown in the alert even though the original html file
doesn't have it.

v3
Before:
- Q: What will happen when next line is uncommented? (line = "e.stopPropagation();")
    - It will prevent bubbling, so only the name of the character will be alerted
- Q: When user clicks on a cell, in what order will the pop-ups appear?
    - We don't know what "true" as third argument to addEventListener does
    - We are going to guess the print order will be "table data" then "table row" then "table".

After:
- We searched up on mozilla documentation, and it appears:
    - true: event listener is run from the root of the document downwards (propagation)
    - false: event listener is run from deeply nested to document root (bubbling)
- Alert order (w/o e.stopPropagation())
    1. The table html since event propagation is on
    2. Name of the character we clicked on since event bubbling is on default
    3. Table row containing the character since event bubbling is on default and this is one level above name of
    character
    - It looks like event propagation is prioritized over bubbling. (addEventListener with 3rd parameter "true" runs
    first then addEventListener w/o "true" runs)
- Alert order (w/ e.stopPropagation())
    - Only the table children will be printed since user click will not propagate down the DOM

v4
Before:
- Q: What will happen when next line is uncommented? (line = "e.stopPropagation();")
    - Only the table HTML will be alerted. This is because event propagation is on and e.stopPropagation() will stop
    click from registering down the DOM
- Q: Does the order in which the event listeners are attached matter?
    - No. Order does not matter for attaching event listeners. HTML only cares about hierarchy and reordering does not
    change the hierarchy.

After:
- Q: What will happen when next line is uncommented? (line = "e.stopPropagation();")
    - Only the table HTML is alerted.
- Q: Does the order in which the event listeners are attached matter?
    - Order does not appear to matter.
