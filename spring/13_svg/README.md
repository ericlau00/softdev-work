# K13: Ask Circles [Change || Die]

Due **T 2020-03-31** 08:00 EST

Estimated time required: <=30min

With your buddy from last work, create an HTML/JS program with the following features:

- An SVG container
- 1 button: clear

Enable the following event listeners for the svg area: (Do NOT put all of this in a single event listener.)

- Clicking on a blank section of the svg area should create a circle at that position.
- Clicking on a circle once should change its color. (No new circles should be added to the svg container.)
- Clicking on a circle a second time should remove the circle and add a new one to the svg container at a random location.

Guidelines:

- index.html
- svg.js

Save to workshop under `13_svg`.
