bring something to the table and people will be more willing to agree with you.

you have to get the fundamentals down or else the fancy stuff wont work

when you see yourself doing something wrong and nobody is telling you, youre in a bad place

its easy to be smart when youre parroting smart people

Set expectations high and people will keep going higher

head fake people into learning things by making it fun

DREAM BIG

I WILL FIX THIS

your profefssion does not describe what you do

being a jerk only limits yourself

brick walls are only for those who dont want to get past them

what an amazing lecture
