# K #27: Sequential Progression

Due **W 2019-12-11**, 08:00, EST.

As a duo... *because you know teamwork makes the dreamwork*
*(pair programming highly advised)*

PHASE I:

1. Locate your notes and code from Intro & AP.
2. Locate `open_me.html` in the util folder in the workshop. Copy it to your working dir. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE
3. Open your browser's developer console, and note any messages you see.
4. Create a file called `funky_town.js` in your working dir...
   - `open_me.html` loads a script file by this name.
   - Write JavaScript functions in this file.
   - Test your functions by calling them via developer console.
5. Develop, then implement `fibonacci(n)`, which returns the nth Fibonacci number.
   - `fibonacci(0) -> 0`
   - `fibonacci(1) -> 1`
   - `fibonacci(2) -> 1`
   - `fibonacci(3) -> 2`
   - `fibonacci(4) -> 3`
6. Develop, then implement `gcd(a,b)`, which returns the greatest common divisor of a and b.
7. Develop, then implement `randomStudent()`, which returns a randomly selected name from a list.
   - You may want to create helper functions or external list variables here.
   - Do whatever you think is needed. Think: S I M P L E.   Think: S M A R T.

Guidelines:

- Note anything notable.
  - We have not discussed reliable JS sources/documentation yet; trust your intuition re: syntax...
  - Pay attention to error messages.
  - Get more familiar with the browser's dev console.
  - Use your QAF: share discoveries, ask Qs.
- File this under `27_js` in your workshop.
  - This folder should contain your HTML and JS files.
- You and your partner should have identical code in your 27_js workshop folders.
