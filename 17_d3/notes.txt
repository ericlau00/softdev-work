Transitions @https://d3js.org/#transitions

    Note that in the following sample code the functions are indented with four spaces instead of two

    d3.selectAll("circle").transition()
        .duration(750)
        .delay(function(d, i) { return i * 10; })
        .attr("r", function(d) { return Math.sqrt(d * scale); });

    This is because the functions are modifying the present object instead of creating a new one.
    The convention in d3 is for functions that return a new object to be indented with 2 spaces.

    In function(d, i), the d represents the data and the i represents the index of the selection

    What is scale in Math.sqrt(d * scale)?

    What is Ur in UrÂ {_groups: Array(1), _parents: Array(1), _name: null, _id: 3}?
    Instead of Pt, which was returned when printing out selections, the transitions return Ur
