# K08: What is it saving the screen from?

Due **F 2020-02-14**, 08:00, EST.

With your last work buddy, augment last work to offer two different types of animations (one or the other; only one at a time).

- Your second animation will mimic the [classic DVD player screensaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI-RY8ducRc)
- Start a new version of either animation by clicking the appropriate button.
- DVD Animation begins when your “I’m waiting for the movie to start” button is clicked.
- All animation stops when your “STOP” button is clicked.
- Insert your team name and roster as H2/H3 elements, respectively, beneath the buttons.

File this under `08_canvas-anim` in your workshop.
