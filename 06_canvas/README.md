# K #06: Dot Dot Dot

Due **W 2020-02-12**, 08:00, EST.

With your partner from last work, and enlightenment gained through workshop perusal...

Create a webpage using HTML5 and JavaScript:

- `index.html`:
  - single canvas (id "playground")
  - single button with text "clear" (id "clear")
- `dotconn.js`:
  - Facilitates drawing a series of connected dots on canvas...
    - when a user clicks within the border of the canvas,
    - a new dot appears, centered at click location
    - new dot is connected by a line to last drawn dot
  - Facilitates clearing of the canvas when user clicks clear button.

File this under `06_canvas` in your workshop.
