                        Imagine that you want to create a mobile app and you want to cater
                        your app to both Android and iOS devices. You would need to develop
                        two separate apps, one for the Google Play Store and one for the iOS
                        App Store. But with Flutter, you would be able to develop under one
                        codebase and still cater to both mobile markets, which saves you a
                        lot of time and effort. So, what is Flutter?

                        Flutter is a software development kit (SDK) made by Google to
                        develop mobile apps. It is a framework written in Dart, a
                        programming language created by Google in 2011. Flutter is a
                        relatively new framework; its stable 1.0 version was released in
                        December 2018. Despite being new, it has a very active community.
                        <span class="highlight"><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/#top-and-trending-projects">In
                                2018 - 2019, Flutter was the third most popular and second fastest growing open source

                    <p>
                        There are so many different options out there to consider when
                        wanting to develop a mobile app. You could write native apps with
                        Java/Kotlin or Swift/Objective-C, native-like apps with React
                        Native, or hybrid apps with Ionic or PhoneGap. Why use Flutter?
                    </p>
                    <div class="h4"><b>Because Flutter is...</b></div>

                            Since Flutter is a cross-platform framework, its Dart-based
                            codebase would help you build mobile apps for both iOS & Android
                            at once. So with Flutter development, you essentially have a
                            single app that can be used successfully on multiple platforms.

                            There is an active community that contributes to the Flutter
                            source code on its GitHub repository, helping the dev team fix
                            bugs and suggest improvements.

                        <p>
                            Native apps written in Java/Kotlin for Android or
                            Swift/Objective-C for iOS have the best performance on their
                            respective platforms and they also have full access to the phone's
                            instruments (e.g. camera, microphone, etc.). Flutter is a
                            native-like framework that compiles down into code that runs at
                            speeds close to native apps.

                            There is a process in Flutter development known as hot reload.
                            Imagine you are working on a Flask app and you fill out a long
                            form and you realize it doesn't work for whatever reason. You make
                            a change in your codebase and then you reload the entire app to
                            see the changes. This doesn't have to be the case in Flutter. Once
                            you make changes in your app, you can simply press a button
                            (typically "r") on your keyboard and you get to see the changes
                            within seconds and you also keep any state your app was in (e.g.
                            filled in forms).

                            Flutter comes with pre-made widgets and components for developers
                            to use. These widgets can either be from a Material UI (Android)
                            or Cupertino (iOS) library. However, the developer has flexibility
                            to create their own style of widgets because Flutter is so
                            malleable.

                        Dart was a relatively obscure language before the advent of Flutter.
                        However, because of Flutter's popularity,
                        <span class="highlight"><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages">Dart became the

                            Everything in Dart can be made into a class or object. This is
                            important for Flutter because Flutter uses classes and inheritance
                            for all of its widgets.

                            This means that Dart code is compiled into native-like machine
                            code that runs incredibly quickly on iOS or Android devices, as if
                            you were actually programming in Java or Swift.

                            This is important for the quick development process with hot
                            reload and hot restart.

                            Dart is in the C family in terms of syntax, and has a lot of
                            crossover with JavaScript and is easy to learn.

                            for dynamic typing, but is also safer than JavaScript because it
                            also supports static typing.

                        <p><b>What are Widgets?</b></p>
                        <p>
                            Everything in Flutter is made up of widgets. A widget is similar to HTML elements like a div
                            or a table. It is basically a UI component with its own set of layout rules and properties.
                            An entire Flutter app is built by composing these widgets together in a cohesive manner.
                            Once you enough of these widgets, you'll get what is called a widget tree.

                        <p>
                            Web pages have a Document Object Model (DOM) and Flutter has a Widget Tree. The DOM and the
                            Widget Tree are very similar to one another. Widget tree describes how widgets are composed
                            with each other. Below is an image showing the similarities between the two.

                            introduces the concept of state management. Notice that when the user clicks add next to one

                        <p>
                            In Flutter, there are stateless and stateful widgets. Stateless widgets are widgets that do
                            not change once the app is created. They can only hold information upon initialization. On
                            the other hand, stateful widgets can hold information that changes over time. In the
                            animation above, the cart is an example of a stateful widget because it holds information
                            about what items the user wants to purchase. This information can change over time,
                            requiring the user to set the state of the widget.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each <code>StatefulWidget</code> contains a <code>State</code> object which handles all
                            changes to state. The <code>State</code> object holds functions that invoke a
                            <code>setState</code> function.
                        </p>

                    <div class="pl-5">
                        <p><b>What is the Build Function?</b></p>
                        <p>
                            <code>build</code> is a function in every Flutter widget that is called as soon as the
                            screen renders a widget. The <code>build</code> function should return a <code>Widget</code>
                            (this can be a complicated tree or a simple widget). One thing to note about the
                            <code>build</code> function is that it is called everytime state is set. Even though this
                            means we may be rerendering an entire widget tree, Flutter is very optimized and this
                            rerendering just takes a split second.
