# K #12: Echo Echo Echo . . .

Due **F 2019-09-27**, 08:00, EST.


Your (duo) job:

**Write a Flask app** to serve a 2-page website (a landing page at `/` and a response page at `/auth`) to echo to a user their input via an HTML form. Your app's response should be rendered via template, and the following should be viewable in the browser:

On both pages:
- your team name and roster

On response page:
- username entered
- request method used
- your greeting to this person

<u>Guidelines+Protips</u>:

- ***Simplicity is divine.***
- Note anything notable. (in your notebook and in-line comments in your code)
- Name your main driver **app.py**
- File this under **12_form** in your workshop. (Both Devos.)
- Use QAF liberally.
