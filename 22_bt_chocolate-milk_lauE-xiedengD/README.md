# K #22: Who Does Frame Work For?

Due **R 2019-11-07**, 8:00am, EST.

**As a duo**, look up either the bootstrap or foundation front-end framework (to be assigned in class).

- Research your framework.
- Create a **single** html page that demonstrates the **key** features of your framework.
    - It should not be too complicated:
        - You do *not* need to showcase every feature in the framework.
        - Highlight the most attractive/useful features of your framework.
        - Your page should provide a simpler on-ramp than the site from which you learned.
    - For now, your primary focus is the CSS-y aspects of your framework (as opposed to the JS-y parts).
    - Your external stylesheet linkage should reference your framework's CDN.
- File this under **22_<bt|fd>_&lt;teamname&gt;** in your workshop. (both Devos)
    - Include framework files necessary to load your page as intended.
    - (e.g., `22_bt_indigoGirls_rayA-saliersE`)
(e.g., `22_fd_runTheJewels_melineJ-renderM`)
